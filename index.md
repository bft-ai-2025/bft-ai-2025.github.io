Welcome to the **1st Workshop on Byzantine Fault Tolerance and Artificial Intelligence Systems (BFT-AI 2025)**!

The workshop will take place on **September 29, 2025**, co-located with [SRDS 2025](https://srds-conference.org/).

As AI becomes central to distributed systems — from large-scale model training to federated learning and autonomous agents — it faces growing challenges around **reliability**, **resilience**, and **trust**. Meanwhile, AI itself offers tools for making distributed systems more fault-tolerant.

**Byzantine faults** pose serious threats across these domains, from corrupted gradients to adversarial nodes. BFT-AI aims to address this urgent intersection.

### Workshop Themes

- **Fault-Tolerant AI**: Resilient training and inference under Byzantine failures
- **AI for Systems Resilience**: Detecting and mitigating system faults using ML
- **Theory**: Convergence guarantees and models under adversarial conditions
- **Infrastructure**: Tools, datasets, reproducibility

Join us in shaping the future of **robust AI systems and trustworthy distributed infrastructures**.
