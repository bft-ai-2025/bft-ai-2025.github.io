## Submission Guidelines
All papers must be written in English and submitted as a single PDF file via the EasyChair system ([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bftai25](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bftai25)), following the IEEE double-column format. Submissions can either be Research Papers (6 pages, including references) or Fast Abstracts (2 pages, excluding references). The first page must clearly state the submission type.

We accept the following submission types:

- **Short Research Papers** (up to 6 pages)
- **Position Papers**


### Review Process

All submissions will undergo double-blind peer review by the workshop Program Committee, evaluating quality, originality, and relevance to BFT and AI. Papers that do not comply with anonymization or formatting guidelines (e.g., page limits) or that have been previously published will be desk-rejected without review.

## Presentation and Publication

At least one author of each accepted paper must register and present their work at the workshop. Accepted Research Papers are eligible for inclusion in the SRDS 2025 proceedings (optional), which requires a full registration at SRDS. Fast Abstracts will not be included in the published proceedings, but will (optionally) be made available at the workshop website.
